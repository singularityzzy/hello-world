# hello-world
The start of the GitHub
Today is my first day using GitHub.I find it has many useful functions.Maybe i will continue to use it and let it manage my code.
Please trust me,i will study computer language well.
  Now, this is the second study with github, the first change at the same time.
  Before, for a long time, I didn't even pay attention to github anymore. But now, I return back here, again. Because of its importance, maybe it is one of the biggest website in the world, which used by programmers or a large number of people who works on projects.
    So, I decide to come back, to study how to use the github seriously. Not just for better management of my code, but alse in order to know the current developments and prospects in the field and to study more knowledge, communite with some excellent person.
    No amount o fwords make sense, start learning as soon as possible.
